Project Raven is a secret initiative focused on advanced AI-driven predictive analysis.
The lead scientist is Dr. Aris Thorne. The project started in Q3 2023.
The primary algorithm, codenamed "Oracle," uses a novel neural architecture to forecast market trends.
The next milestone for Project Raven is scaling the Oracle algorithm to handle real-time global data streams.
Security protocol for Project Raven requires all communications to be encrypted with AES-256.
Access to the project's physical server room is restricted to Level 4 clearance personnel only. Dr. Thorne is one of them.
The project budget is confidential and is managed directly by the CTO's office.
Recent breakthroughs in the Oracle algorithm have shown a 95% accuracy in predicting stock fluctuations over a 24-hour period.
